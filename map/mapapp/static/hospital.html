            The Government Medical College & Hospital Ariyalur caters to both urban as well as rural parts of Ariyalur and nearby districts, covering approximately 9,60,000 people from marginalized backgrounds. These people suffered the most during the pandemic due to acute shortage of oxygenated beds at various government hospitals. Even though Government Medical College & Hospital Ariyalur had allocated 400 general beds for COVID-19 patients, the lifesaving critical care equipment available at the hospital was not adequate.
